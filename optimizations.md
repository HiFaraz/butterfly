virtual dom

DONE recursively define proxies - this can catch new properties that were not get/set before

if I don't have a match on a select, I should select a blank

DONE don't pollute the namespace!

handle promises as data values

DONE two way data binding!!!!

respond to changes in watcher (create another proxy, and a map of paths to actual nodes as well as the binders) - what did I mean by this?

catch new live values added by new root data object

also work on contenteditable objects
